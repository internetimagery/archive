# Keep It!

Archive your Maya files. Simply.

    import keepit
    keepit.main()
    
* Add a message and archive processes in the archive folder will be run.
* Add no message (just hit enter) and maya will save as is. No archive will happen.

This command above can be used stand alone or to replace ctrl-s to save the scene. No message, no archive.
